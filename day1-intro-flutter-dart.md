# Introduction to Flutter and Dart

## About
This lesson introduces students to Flutter framework and the Dart programming language. Students will learn about the advantages of Flutter for cross-platform development and get hands-on experience with Dart's core concepts.

## What is Flutter?

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Here's how Flutter's architecture enables this:

```mermaid

    A[Flutter App] --> B[Flutter Framework]
    B --> C[Foundation Library]
    B --> D[Rendering Layer]
    B --> E[Widget Layer]
    B --> F[Material/Cupertino]
    C --> G[Platform Channels]
    G --> H[Android Platform]
    G --> I[iOS Platform]
    style A fill:#b7e3fc
    style B fill:#90caf9
    style C,D,E,F fill:#64b5f6
    style G fill:#42a5f5
    style H,I fill:#1e88e5
```

### Key Features
- **Hot Reload**: Make changes and see them instantly
- **Single Codebase**: Write once, deploy everywhere
- **Custom Widgets**: Build beautiful native interfaces
- **High Performance**: Direct access to platform APIs

## Understanding Widget Trees

In Flutter, everything is a widget. Widgets form a hierarchy that describes your app's UI:

```mermaid

    A[MaterialApp] --> B[Scaffold]
    B --> C[AppBar]
    B --> D[Body: Container]
    D --> E[Column]
    E --> F[Text Widget]
    E --> G[Button Widget]
    E --> H[Image Widget]
    style A fill:#ffcdd2
    style B fill:#ef9a9a
    style C,D fill:#e57373
    style E fill:#ef5350
    style F,G,H fill:#f44336
```

## Development Environment Setup

Follow these steps to set up your Flutter development environment:

```mermaid

    A[Install Flutter SDK] --> B[Set up IDE]
    B --> C[Configure Environment Variables]
    C --> D[Install Platform SDKs]
    D --> E[Create First Project]
    E --> F[Run Flutter Doctor]
    style A fill:#c8e6c9
    style B fill:#a5d6a7
    style C fill:#81c784
    style D fill:#66bb6a
    style E fill:#4caf50
    style F fill:#43a047
```

### Setup Steps
1. Download Flutter SDK from flutter.dev
2. Extract and add to PATH
3. Install VS Code or Android Studio
4. Install Flutter and Dart plugins
5. Run `flutter doctor` to verify setup

## Introduction to Dart

Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform. Key features include:

### Variables and Types
- Strong typing with type inference
- `var`, `final`, and `const` keywords
- Built-in types: `int`, `double`, `String`, `bool`, `List`, `Map`
- Null safety with `?` and `!` operators

### Functions
```dart
// Named parameters with null safety
void printUserInfo({
    required String name,
    int? age,
    String? email
}) {
    print('Name: $name');
    if (age != null) print('Age: $age');
    if (email != null) print('Email: $email');
}
```

### Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and interfaces
- Abstract classes and mixins
- Factory constructors
- Method overriding

## Level Up Content

| Topic | Time | Skills |
|-------|------|---------|
| Dart Async Programming | 30 min | Understanding Future, async/await, and Streams |
| Flutter DevTools | 30 min | Using Flutter DevTools for debugging and performance optimization |

### Async Programming
```dart
// Example of async/await in Dart
Future<String> fetchUserData() async {
    final response = await http.get('api/user');
    return response.body;
}
```

### DevTools Features
- Widget Inspector
- Performance Profiling
- Memory Analysis
- Network Monitoring
- Source-level Debugger
